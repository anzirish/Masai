        <h2>The Myth Behind the Man</h2>
        <p>
          Kvothe, the gifted arcanist and infamous adventurer, is more than the
          sum of the tales whispered in taverns. From his days with the Edema
          Ruh to mastering Sympathy at the University, his journey is one of
          legend, loss, and learning. But is the truth more powerful than the
          myth?

        <h2>The Archives and the Name of the Wind</h2>
        <p>
          Deep within the University lies the Archives — a place of boundless
          knowledge and buried secrets. Kvothe’s obsession with naming and
          uncovering the lost Name of the Wind brings him closer to an ancient
          power that defies comprehension, and deeper into the mystery
          surrounding the Chandrian.
