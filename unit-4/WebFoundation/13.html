  <body style="background-color: blueviolet;">
    <h1 style="color: blue;">Welcome to Galadriel's Realm</h1>
    <h2 style="color: aqua;">
      I am Galadriel, the Lady of Lothlórien, an elf of the First Age and bearer
      of one of the Three Elven Rings of Power. I have witnessed the rise and
      fall of kingdoms and have walked among the stars and shadows of
      Middle-earth. Wisdom, light, and resilience are the foundations of my
      being.

    <h2 style="color: chartreuse;">
      In the golden woods of Lothlórien, I find joy in stargazing, singing the
      songs of the Eldar, nurturing the mallorn trees, and studying ancient
      elven lore. I also cherish the art of telepathy and exploring the
      mysteries of time and vision through the Mirror of Galadriel.
